/*
    1. Write less code, do more
    2. Easier to be declarative rather than imperative
    3. The API is much more concise, but generally there is less to teach.
    4. Abstractions are easier to reason about and compose.
    5. Rich ecosystem for custom hooks.
    6. Worry about performance when necessary (re-renders aren't always bad + profile, profile, profile!)
    7. So about that bottom line...
